    <h2>Possible UI Solutions</h2>

    <h3>Safety and Comfort</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Filter by bike types to narrow down search results.</li>
        <li>Safety Rating: Display safety ratings prominently for each bike. Possible through a scale range (lower
            safety ratings describe better fit for professionals and tricks, whereas higher safety ratings are better
            for beginnings/older populations riding casually).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Beginner Friendly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Popup with a brief description next to each bike specification (i icon) briefly outlining what each quality
            means and why it's important.</li>
        <li>"For Beginners" title in the navigation bar linked to Beginner's Guide blog. Provides an overview all
            necessary considerations for new riders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preview button for bike cards in home page for clear images of bikes from different angles - clarify what
            the
            bike will look like for anxious users/users who care about looking cool.</li>
        <li>Suggested/recommended accessories section for each selected bike: "This would go well with..." for users who
            want to stand out/decorate their bikes.</li>
        <li>User Reviews: Allow users to upload images and reviews of their customized bikes. Users also should be able
            to filter the reviews (With Images Only) and only acess reviews with images.</li>
        <li>Color Customization: Allow users to visualize how different color options would look on the bike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Affordability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Filter bikes based on budget range, ensuring filters act as filters, not sort options. Users can click on
            "budget" input their range, which causes the system to only return bikes that fit within that range.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Intent</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear category/terrain type tag on the top of each bike item page.</li>
        <li>Tag indicating "Best for XYZ" based on user personas' scoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Description of estimated lifespan for each bike.</li>
        <li>Maintenance Tips for each bike model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Customization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pop-up indicating suitable heights for each bike.</li>
        <li>Sort by height button with an equation for users to input their height and get relevant recommendations
            through a scale. The scale will return where their their measurements position within the desired range for the
            product.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Smart Consumerism</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Latest Technology" navigation category for users to find cutting-edge features.</li>
    </ul>
