<h1 class="title">Feature Ideation</h1>
<p>Identify possible UI solutions to address the stories. Not necessarily 1-for-1, just let the stories suggest ideas for components. A menu. A big photo. A search bar. An expanding drawer. Sometimes a single component such as a checkbox is enough. Sometimes you may end up with a set of components that work together, such as a search-field, search button, and results list. Keep an eye out for solutions that address more than one story/need, or that can be enhanced to address additional needs. For instance, a basic search bar might be enhanced with an 'auto-suggest' feature.</p>

<p>Organize your solutions into pages, or views. What views need to exist? What responsibilities does each view have?</p>

<p>Format your decisions in a document (or set of documents) that conveys as much as possible about your decisions, with as little effort as possible. The idea is to communicate a plan that's both easy to follow, and easy to change.</p>
