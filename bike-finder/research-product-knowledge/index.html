    <h1>Sources</h1>

    <h2>Google Search for Bikes for Beginners (Women's)</h2>
    <p>First things first, I typed into Google "bikes for beginners women's" to identify bikes that are easy to use for
        less experienced riders and comfortable for women's anatomy.</p>
    <p>My first source was a <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/g3635s/good_beginner_womans_bikes_low_budget/">Reddit
            Thread</a> where users discussed good beginner women's bikes on a low budget.</p>

    <h2>Bikes Direct</h2>
    <p>Someone in the Reddit thread mentioned <a href="https://bikesdirect.com/">Bikes Direct</a>. I visited the site
        but was displeased with the UI and design, so I exited and went back to the search query results.</p>

    <h2>Brooklyn Bicycle</h2>
    <p>Under "explore brands" in the Google search, I found <a href="https://www.brooklynbicycleco.com/">Brooklyn
            Bicycle</a>, a local bike shop that would be close to home. I went to the filter tab to see if there were
        any beginner friendly tags, then I went to the navigation bar and under "Shop by Category" I chose "Comfort and
        Recreation" as the second closest to meaning casual user/beginner.
        This section outlined some characeristics of comfort bikes like the upright riding position, cushy sprung
        saddle, all-weather components, and professional assmeble. None of these particularly struck me as providing my
        specific needs, but were impressive nonetheless. Scrolling also confirmed that this category wasn't for me
        because almost every bike had "Speed" in the title. I then moved to the "Commuter Bike" category which
        immediately struck me as the better option as the characeteriscs included a wide gearing range, puncture
        resistant tires, mounts galore, etc. All of the bikes ranges from $599 to $1099, so I wanted one of the cheapest
        options that didn't have "Speed" in the title and had pretty color options upon hovering. I ended up selecting
        the <a href="https://www.brooklynbicycleco.com/collections/commuter-bikes/products/wythe">Wythe Fix Bike</a>
        from the Commuter Bike category.</p>

    <h2>SixThreeZero Article</h2>
    <p>Another source I found was an article by SixThreeZero called "THE BEST WOMEN'S BIKES FOR BEGINNERS." I used it to
        better understand what features to look for in a beginner's bike. I learned some interesting tips, like how
        frame mateiral is important to determine the weight of your bike: carbon fiber is more lightweight, but steel
        and aluminum frames are heavier.
        Surprsingly, I learned that Tubeless wheels, though not available on many entry-level models, essentially can't
        be pinched or punctured, which translates to a lesser likelihood that I'll ever get a flat tire while out
        riding. This led me to the <a
            href="https://www.sixthreezero.com/products/womens-evryjourney-touring-hybrid-bike/?variant=30152820545">EVRYjourney</a>
        bike.</p>
    <p>The model boasts itself on having 26-inch wheels with 2-inch semi-slick tires for excellent roll and a cushioned,
        stable ride, along with a lightweight aluminum frame for easy maneuvering. I also exlored the colors and loved
        the unique color palettes. Rather than having one simple color over the bike, they have one color over the main
        parts and then a different color over the rums of the tire. The bike was also $420 which was cheaper than the
        other options.</p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>For beginner bikes, it's important that they have strong, stable tires and are lightweight. Understanding factors
        like frame material and tire types can aid in making an informed decision. Safety features and intended use also
        play a crucial role in choosing the right bike.</p>

    <h1>Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Big Questions for Buyers</h2>
    <p>Like myself, buyers may be faced with questions such as which bike offers the best safety features, especially
        for those intending to purchase a bike for commuter use. They also might question how to find a bike with
        specific features while staying within their budget.</p>

    <h2>Priorities for Buyers</h2>
    <p>Buyers might prioritize safety over aesthetics, and equally important, easy access to safety details and
        beginner-related information for the product. Cost is a significant factor influencing the products they
        consider due to relatability.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gear Speeds</h2>
    <p>When purchasing from SixThreeZero, I encountered the option to choose speed (1, 3, 7, 21) and didn't understand
        the significance. After further research, I learned that these numbers represent gear speeds, with 1 being
        single-speed and only suitable for flat ground and 21 suitable for both flat ground and steep hills.</p>
    <p>This was very useful information that I had to find <a

        at a separate forum on the site.</p>
