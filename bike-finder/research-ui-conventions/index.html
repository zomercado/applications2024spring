<h1>Summary</h1>

<h2>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h2>
<p>Color select is almost always circular multi-select options, and sort options use a dropdown menu.</p>

<h2>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h2>
<p>The Taylor USA site had the overview section of product description already expanded as a drop-down menu option. This was different because normally sites have all of the sections already collapsed so that the user can manually expand them if they would like to explore the information more. Also, the same thing as I mentioned above, that the Casetify site did not allow for interactive design upon hovering and exploring the site.</p>

<h2>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</h2>
<p>There was a customize option on each product card for the Hydroflask website, and this is specific because the products they sell are much more personal. The other options are more retail stores that provide one type of product and you purchase it if it suits your needs. So the customize element for the water bottle product feels specific/unique to stores that sell more personal items. For the Casetify website, there were more drop-down select matrix flows to narrow down specific models because selling phone cases means that there are many different variations, and narrowing them down is important for the user to get what they need. Also, the Casetify site offered product comparison to learn about the differences between the type of case options (i.e., Ultra Bounce Case MagSafe Compatible, Impact Ring Stand Case MagSafe Compatible, etc).</p>

<h2>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?</h2>
<p>I think that what made Hydroflask stand out was the use of vibrant colors and unique imagery (i.e., people hiking with their bright pink or blue water bottles). And this allowed me to remember the site content more than other sites which had a standard white background with a simple product gallery - while simple, this approach does make sense and has a place because it allows the products to stand out, rather than being drowned out by distracting backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</h2>
<p>My experiences being disrupted/confused/bothered were with the Taylor USA site, where we scrolled all the way down, the footer cut off some of the main content, and it's obviously an error of the responsive design. I also felt disrupted on the Casetify site because we were exploring the content with the expectation that at the very least, the buttons would be interactive. Upon discovering that they weren't, I halted and felt a moment of discomfort. This response occurred because it changed the conventional, familiar flow that I experience when typically navigating modern websites.</p>
